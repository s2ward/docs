            <p>Now there are a couple of complicated pieces to the puzzle we have to answer first until the answer to 469 emerges and starts to become obvious. I'll hold your hand through epic tales of ancient times that are <strong>riddled</strong> with riddles and inconspicious details that unlocks doors to bizarre new ways to look at Tibia.</p>
            <p>An extremely interesting place is the Shattered Isles and its history.</p>

                  Malunga: <strong>These isles</strong> hold more secrets than those that meet the eye. I am convinced that <strong>once a great civilisation prospered here. Some sort of disaster wiped out almost completely any trace of it</strong>.

                  Malunga: Magic is not available everywhere at the same strength and intensity. There are areas that are dry like a desert, magically spoken, others are rich of magic. <strong>At some places magic flows as strong as if  there were springs of magic</strong> …<br>
                  Malunga: At those places the savants build <strong>magical centres</strong> of great importance. My researches have shown that the chaotic currents of magic must have been more structured once and much stronger than today …<br>
                  Malunga: With the right knowledge the civilisation of the past could have worked literally marvellous with those energies …

            <p>This sounds exactly like what we have been looking at, strong 'magic-currents/red-lines/ley-lines/web-of-the-dragon kings', and magical centres of great importance on the gates of the magic web.</p>

               <p>Player: <strong>disaster</strong><br>
                  Malunga: The disaster took place at least some centuries ago. Our researches convinced us that the isles here belonged to <strong>a single landmass in the past</strong>. That should give you an idea of the extent of this catastrophe.
               </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>If this was once a single landmass, it seems utterly and completely destroyed.<br>
               Funny how It kinda looks like Roshamuul belonged to the Daraman continent at some point, and we can also find that Issavi and Krailos were one until the 'great scar' separated them.

            <ul>
               <li>Way too much confusion going on</li>
               <li>At least two races - both humanoid.</li>
               <li>A single landmass that was shattered into isles in some gargantuan catastrophe.</li>
               <li>Immense amount of magic on the shattered isles, which once were even greater on the Non-shattered continent, which could explain why:</li>
               <li>Ferumbras tower is nearby - Morgaroth, Ghazbaran as well.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We can find varying information on this ancient subject, some of these are:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Two races, one on land and one in sea</li>
               <li>Several races who lived on land while being attacked by the sea</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Could it be the Quara?</p>

            <p>The quara does not seem to be the ones that are in 'control', they rather look like some experiments, amalgamations.<br>

            <p>I mean, they'd know right? Being part fish and all.</p>
            <p>Okay.. so what are they?<br>
               Well, they are amalgamations.<br>
               We see combined creatures everywhere.

            <p>We now have about 3~ places to look, where</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Calassa contains Quaras and is very close... but these are seemingly feral. Not so interesting.  But they got coral and pearls.</li>
               <li>Fiehonja does not contain Quara, however, it does contain a lot of gold and deeplings, 'Creatures of the Deep'.</li>
               <li>Sunken City, is kinda faraway but also contain Quara, where the fire-feathered <em>serpent</em> lies by a highly advanced civilization, which has monsters such as the huge Ankrahmunian mummy 'The Ravager' and renegade Quaras, with temples full of snakey decorations.</li>

            <p>In Rathleton lore, we find that some time before the humans arrived in Rathleton, some highly advanced researchy things had abandoned the city. Could this have been right after the catastrophe?</p>

            <p>Rathleton is run on glooth, which is in reality just slime enhanced with different elements- often energy. This can create a wide range of practical every-day uses, such as clothing and immortality by sammiches.</p>
            <p>Excerpts from research on Oramond Folklore:</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>They commanded some <strong>technological knowledge beyond what I've seen anywhere</strong>. <strong>Perhaps those ancient ruins are all what's left from the mythical civilisation of Yalahar. Perhaps while strolling through Rathleton I've walked through what the ravages of time left over from the famous city itself</strong>? However, when the first humans arrived, the city had been abandoned and lain in ruins since long ago. The humans, wherever they might have come from, settled for a simple life in the ruins, in ignorance of the marvels and wonders around them.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
               <li>Highly technological ancient race</li>
               <li>Ruins, that were either quite recently destroyed or were abandoned a long time ago.</li>
               <li>However, things seems to have been kinda operational, since the humans were able to rebuild and use it somehow.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
               <p>It is uncertain what exactly happened, but I assume at some point their <strong>digging and exploring awakened some ancient evil</strong>, something so powerful that they stood no chance of resistance.

               <p>But if any of the ancient fairy tales are worth something, it was not some vampire, perhaps not even a physical being. Nonetheless, dark times of servitude began for the people of the isle. <strong>Slavery and taxes in blood was their lot for many generations</strong>.<br>
                  <strong>This did only change with the arrival of 'princess' Ramora</strong>. Now this person is shrouded in mystery, too. Though each story claims <strong>highest nobility for her, there is no record at all about such a princess in any archive that I had access to</strong>. This might mean nothing though, <strong>as it is entirely possible that this princess and her conquest date back to the last days of the mythical Corpse Wars</strong>. Though native lore and that of the invaders mingle here, it is often mentioned that <strong>things took place in the time when 'dead men walked'</strong>.
               </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This must be during the Corpse Wars, which suddenly ended &lt;<em>chough catastrophe cough</em>&gt;</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>Given the constant threat of the Corpse Wars, it seems likely that those incidents triggered <strong>the exodus of said princess and her people</strong>. Still, the nobility of this princess is disputable. <strong>Granted, there is next to no record that survived from those times.</strong> It is entirely possible that the princess was some tribe's ruler or something like that. <strong>The key here is that no heritage or title but that of 'princess' in her name connect to her in any existing lore.</strong> Knowing to what an end the nobility goes to preserve their family names, at least ist must strike one as <strong>odd that no traceable surname survived in all those tales</strong>. The next thing are <strong>clashing reports about how the exodus took place</strong>.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>We have a princess, the researchers had not heard of a kingy ruler.<br>
               We also see a lot of details pointing at this happening a really, REALLY long time ago.<br>
               The snakemen talk of kings and princes in the old times.. Prince Drazzak in Roshamuul..  as written by <strong>Maha</strong>theb's scribe: 'the dark prince Arkhothep', or perhaps you've heard about the fair, garden-loving princess <strong>Maha</strong>ruh - perhaps this is why they named the Tiquandan river: <strong>Maha</strong>ji
            </p>

            <p>Hinting at the true extent of the djinn wars.. we are getting side-tracked, let's move on:</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>Yet in <strong>even other stories</strong> it is said that the '<strong>goodly seapeople</strong>' took pity of the plight of the princess, and that their ships came from the mists to carry her people away. <strong>Interestingly, the 'seapeople' are a consistent element in various tales about the exodus</strong>.<br>
                  ...<br>
                  In <strong>several other stories</strong>, the seapeople <strong>at least encountered the princess and for some reason or other agreed to guide her through the sea that was in turmoil due to violent storms and savage sea creatures</strong>. <strong>Most descriptions of the seapeople picture them to be tall, slender, with pointy ears and bluish skin</strong>.
               </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Here we get some information that we can actually cross-reference with Malungas researches...</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>Malunga: The little we know about the extinct civilisation hints about a <strong>magically advanced race of humanoids</strong>, <strong>possibly of elven heritage</strong>, that once inhabited those isles until the disaster struck …</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In the final part:</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>they fought the '<strong>other minions</strong>' of the blood lord, often described as beasts entirely made up of blood and gore.<br>
                  It is likely that having fought in the Corpse Wars and having survived them, Ramora and her followers had weapons, tactics and magic available to fight even such abomination, without running away screaming at the first confrontation. Finally they cornered and slew the beast that oppressed the isle. Probably in a gesture of unification <strong>she married</strong> (? <strong>the stories here a irritatingly vague</strong>) <strong>a local man that was declared to be some hero in the whole affair</strong>. Bringing with them more determination than the natives had and <strong>possessing some knowledge that was alien to them, the new arrivals changed the isle's civilisation significantly. Houses were built, the crude machines where put to a more efficient use, and more effort was put into understanding the relics of the past</strong>.
               </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Apparently a hero with alien technology some time after the catastrophe charmed and married the extremely powerful princess Ramora. That's mad!</p>
            <p>Curious that they fought the 'other minions' as described by the quite reliable blue Djinn Ocelus:</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>One on land and <strong>the others</strong> in the shadows of the deep sea</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Like we read about the Shiron'Fal:</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>Making their hidden moves, <strong>manipulating people and events</strong>, taking whatever they needed to increase their power. Their agents travelled the world in <strong>many forms and disguises</strong>, looking for relics and recruits.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This makes me think they are a mix of races, outcasts.. because yeah, pretty much all traces we find of them are that, amalgamations &amp; grunts.<br>
               Imagine the gathered knowledge of all of these races.
            </p>
            <p>So from now on, I'm going to refer to them as <strong>the others</strong> - instead of snake-men-lizard-quara-fish-minotaur-zathroth-demon-stuff-etc. There are many other mentions of 'the others' as well.</p>
            <p>I think we see mayhaps two of these races while crashing during a 'shortcut' from Port Hope to Yalahar. (but could be another shortcut). This would otherwise be concealed by the Yalaharis usual masks...</p>

            <p>Looks like som humans and knobheads!  By the looks of it, they were friends at some point on the shattered isles. I get strong Yalaharian vibes. These were supposedly the good guys, the lightbringers. The wise philosophers and relentless scientists.</p>

            <p>This leaves us with, the Njey - The creatures of the deep, and Sunken City.<br>
               In Sunken city, which lies just west of Rathleton, we find tons of snakes and teleporters.  This just HAS to be remnants of the ancient Shiron'Fal.

            <p>There are tons more, as you've seen throughout the world.</p>
            <p>One reason i'm showing all of this is because figuring out who is fighting who and which side is which - and where - is difficult to understand, considering our protagonists Zathroth, Kirok and the bonelords had a wide arsenal of literal nightmarish creatures and goofy cattle, and were able to teleport around as they please.</p>
            <p>And we can without a shadow of a doubt say,<br>
               that the others, the outcasts.. created the quara, sea serpents, dragons and pretty much everything snakey.  We can connect multiple places to the Ankrahmunians, where our dear <strong>serpent</strong>ine tower lies.

            <p>Quite a lot of gold down here. Good zteel.</p>
            <p>For those of you that don't know, Deepling language, or &quot;Jekhr&quot; is a custom language in Tibia.<br>
               As described by the Yalaharian researcher Lagatos - who has written every english book in Fiehonja:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>The Deepling language is not yet understood to its fullest. However, it mostly consists of nouns and basic, infinite verbs.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Lagatos has also provided us with a couple of dictionaries.</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>Exercises, Chapter I: Pronouns<br>
                  I/me = jh<br>
                  we/us = jey<br>
                  you = na<br>
                  the/that/this = jeh<br>
                  ...
               </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Some books are written by deeplings.  These are difficult to understand but are closest to the truth.<br>
               <img src="_resources/85d53d6193854373a3cf6307b18a7964.png" alt="20f8ff58cd94ec7f6592e61ae241ca7c.png">
            </p>
            <p>When talking to NPC's, we use written(latin) form so the NPC can understand us.<br>
               When translating to English, we can use the written form to lookup in provided dictionaries, and if we want, transpose the words to pronounced form - however, this has no documented gain at all. Flavour?
            </p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>Note that when spoken aloud, a 'T' (as in 'h' or 'H') will be pronounced 'aa'. It is only pronounced 'h' if at the beginning of a word. The word 'jakhn' (to destroy/destruction) will be pronounced: &quot;jakaan&quot;</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
               <p>Additional notes: Most complex words are constructed of smaller basic vocabulary. For example: 'surface' ('gouthn') consists of 'over/up' ('gou') and 'face' ('thn'). Ligatures appear as consonants only as in 'Qjell' ('Qjell'). An 'i' at the end of a word will always be pronounced as 'ee'. A verb is negated if it is followed by 'ro'. For example: 'lume' ('reach') followed by 'ro' ('not') means 'not to reach'.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>And now you know what tools we have to work with.<br>
               The Njey seem to worship a god called Qjell, or to us: Kjell.
            </p>
            <p>Let's read about the first coming of Qjell, the most important event to all deeplings.</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p><strong>The Book of Qjell, The First Coming</strong></p>
               <p><strong>Edition II, Translation from 'Jekhr' (language of the Deeplings)<br>
                  By Lagatos, Chronicler and Scholar</strong>
               </p>
               <p>When the creatures of the deep were born under the eternal suns, <strong>a great evil befell the seas. An evil never described in writing nor mentioned by a scholar for it was blackness incarnate</strong>. Chaos and darkness reigned and the deep suffered direly. For centuries our world was shattered and occluded from light and warmth. Those born under a weak tide were abducted, captured, eaten by fiends of the void. The strongest would prevail, but their numbers were small. Our race was facing extinction before they were touched by even a single beam of light. It was in these darkest of nights and the deepest of depths that a Deepling would rise to face the unlight. It was Qjell who was the first, the one to stand against these vile odds. <strong>He lived as one of us, he suffered among us. He reached for the surface and brought the light, his gift, to undo the deeds of the wicked</strong>. To cleanse the deep and to wash our faces for we were to expect the twin suns. And he drove away the evil and was light incarnate. <strong>This was the time known as the First Coming. We shall await the Second Coming</strong>. And for we are given time on this world, <strong>we shall use it to erect</strong> <strong>walls and pillars, temples and towers, gardens and cities</strong>. For we shall <strong>prosper and grow to await the Coming of our God King Qjell</strong>.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>It sounds like Qjell came from the deep, came from the surface and lived as one of them.<br>
               I think whatever ascended just died, and sometime after someone &quot;non-deepling&quot; lived as one of them.
            </p>
            <p>We know that this is a religious book about ancient happenings, so details are a bit dark and fluffy.</p>
            <ul>
               <li>There was a darkness in the depths</li>
               <li>Something came, that brought light</li>
               <li>This brought a lot of joy, they built temples, cities, gardens, towers, started writing...</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And! it does share <strong>similarities</strong> with what Ztiss told us earlier</p>
            <blockquote>
               <ol>
                  <li>He ztole ze zecret of zteel from ze <strong>evil lordz of ze deep and flooded zeir cavez</strong> to drown zem.</li>
               </ol>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Continuing this fish and frog-lore, at some point there was a shift:</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>It is not known how old (or young) this civilisation was when they decided to &quot;reduce&quot; their society to cattle and shepherd, but it is possible that they found this to be the only form that guarantees survival of the race as a whole. So far this concept did not fail.</p>
               <p>Although violent and often primitive in nature, these creatures of the deep are <strong>strangely interconnected and should be considered intelligent beings</strong>. They communicate and interact with each other on a higher level than most inhabitants of the Tibia oceans. However, each of their existences is mostly focused on specific tasks.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>It's also interesting because we have been looking at several languages.</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>As each Deepling has to play its role, <strong>the social structure of their society is clearly structured and layered in strict castes</strong>. From what is known through collected studies and vague interpretations of writings in the foreign language of higher Deeplings, <strong>higher castes suppress members of lower classes systematically</strong>. This is achieved by radical control of everyday life of lower Deeplings and strict classification. Besides fear and oppression, higher classes especially utilise limitations to reach these goals. Parts of the society will not be able to access specific religious sites, sacred writings or even habitats of higher members.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>And it's up to us to figure out what caused the shift - while decrypting cruel ciphers and especially tricky quests such as liquid black.</p>
            <p>An easy book to decipher is depicting the welcome of a male visitor some time after Qjell.</p>

            <p>I de-maddened the dictionary slightly without changing any meaning by removing some clutter like boil/boiling -&gt; boiling.<br>
               Makes it easier to get the gist of it while not changing any meaning that Lagatos gave us.
            </p>
            <p>Some of these books are quite strange and deceiving, where we have to use some thinking with the dictionaries to get the meaning, which without cross-referencing, looks like a book with a good message - VERY sneaky from Cipsoft...</p>

            <p>Still weird that Qjell bringer light, eh?</p>
            <p>Could it be related?</p>

            <p>I just love these translations, they bringer me so much joy.</p>
            <p>Following is a book depicting a sinister swimmer-</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>The Swimmer, translation by Lagatos.</p>
               <p>And when the Swimmer reached the bottom of the sea, he was enlightened by the beauty of the deep. The lively cities of the Deeplings greeted him from the bosom of the ocean. Drowning in colour and light, the Swimmer reached the sea's moist bed, surrounded by guardians of the deep. But their welcome was of little warmth. They did not see a foreigner nor a stranger, <strong>not a visitor but a threat</strong>.</p>
               <p>The Swimmer Part II<br>
                  Translation from 'Jekhr' (language of the Deeplings)<br>
                  By Lagatos, Chronicler and Scholar
               </p>
               <p><strong>Held captive for two lifetimes he became one with the stone and coral that bound him</strong>. He longed for the world above. Wandering the skies again in broad daylight. Roaming the deserts, mountains and vast plains of the world like he used to. Floating a drop above the rain and dodging beams of the twin suns, he would embrace the disembodied freedom of his true self.</p>
               <p>He was a <strong>spirit and a ghost</strong>. His soul moved into the very walls and fences of every house and court. Claiming the very foundations of this watery city as his own.</p>
               <p><strong>The Swimmer now lingers in shadowy corners, damp and dark and hollow. Chasing flickers of light touching the ground like a cat born of fog</strong>. When the creatures of the deep fell for the first visitor, he mourned the loss of the good in their souls. When the colour finally fled from its last enclave, he longed for redemption.</p>
               <p>What is left of the light once brought to us, what remains of the fires once thriving us, it is he.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Funny how these are the only 'first edition' books in all of Jekhr.<br>
               There are other inconspicuous details, such as, how do the Deeplings know what the swimmer longs for?<br>
               We also find that the swimmer was the first visitor.
            </p>
            <p>In another confusing book of Lagatos, it seems that the library was abandoned long ago, and apparently there has been a second coming?</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>The Drowned Library<br>
                  Personal notes of Lagatos, Chronicler and Scholar
               </p>
               <p><strong>The once bright centre of the Deepling community has been given up ever since the days of the Second Coming</strong>. After their leaders were convinced that their future lied above sea level, more and more of them stopped maintaining the archives and tending for the books. With the Deeplings rallying for war, <strong>the great halls of the library were soon abandoned</strong>. <strong>The culture of these creatures is complex enough to produce a significant amount of literature. I have found several works about sea animals, food, architecture and even early philosophical theories. However, progression of the Deepling culture in this direction has long been abandoned in favour of war preparations or social oppression of lower castes</strong>.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, just to make it a bit more difficult and a bit more solveable, on the same island - Quirefang, shit went down.</p>
            <p>The name Faltugios pops up numerous times in a series of (8!) books we find in the hive.<br>
               It seems to have been written by a paranoid Yalaharian captain-researcher on a mission to create a crawler-army to save the world from IT. I will show you some excerpts of IT.

            <p>The hive is above Gray beach, just east of Zao and north of Kilmaresh.<br>

            <blockquote>
               <p>The journey has been uneventful so far and the weather is fine. <strong>Faltugios</strong> suggested to run the ship with full power but I decided it is better not to take even the slightest risk on our mission. I am still convinced that <strong>IT</strong> will not allow us that easily to continue with our plans. Admittedly, I am <strong>extremely nervous</strong>, but this is no surprise considering the circumstances. Our knowledge is a burden not easy to bear. Therefore I keep these notes, knowing I'll have to destroy them when the time has come. I'm a bit nervous but I'm also anxious to learn what we will be able to do for the best of the world. Time will tell. ... <strong>A sea serpent has attacked our ship. Could it be IT's doing</strong>? Though the serpent was quite huge, it was no match for our ship's weaponry. Still, could IT know our power? Or the strength of IT's tools? Even if IT is not working consciously against our efforts, it might be an instinctive reflex like an animal that flicks flies. If it was an effort to stop us, it would mean that IT is aware of our movements. Could it be?</p>

            <p>The eight books are COMPLETE madness, extreme paranoia. Very fun to read, it reminds me of my descent into madness second-guessing every idea and thought.</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>I will not allow IT to triumph. ... Several members of the expedition seem suspicious to me. <strong>Faltugios is the most vocal of them of course</strong>. He was criticising me right from the start and I wonder if he is an unwilling - or perhaps even a willing - tool of IT. Yes, perhaps some of them know more than they admit. It has been always our nature to be inquisitive and sceptical. What if one of them has learnt more than he was meant to know? What if he'd become tainted by the knowledge and perhaps was seduced with lies and promises?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>And at some point, Faltugios started to investigate the deeplings, &quot;fishmen&quot;.</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>The attacks of the fishmen continue. The more we kill, the more they seem to call from the depths of the sea for their next attack. This can't be a coincidence anymore. It has to be IT's work. Nothing else makes any sense. <strong>Faltugios suggested to capture the creatures to try to communicate with them to learn their motivation</strong>.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>All the while the situation in Yalahar grew tense</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>The reinforcements still did not arrive. Actually, they were not even sent. <strong>I wonder what is happening in Yalahar</strong>. I heard about some quarrels in the circle and civil unrest. All foreigners are put under greater surveillance and the defences are <strong>strengthened against an attack that the circle can not specify to the masses</strong>.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The captain requested backup forces, however did not go along with the new commander at all.<br>
               At some point, the captain kills Faltugios and Traks, the commander of backup forces.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>The unrest in Yalahar is growing. I am on my own. I wonder if there are contingency plans? Am I expendable? Is my project already deemed a failure <strong>due to the whisperings of IT?</strong> I cannot allow them to succeed. It is up to me to stop them. I alone can do it, stop them. I will save the world! ... It is done! <strong>I locked up Faltugios and that stupid brute</strong> in a chamber and let some of the experimental specimens free. As expected the creatures perished, but they distracted this duo of traitors long enough to flood the room with gas. The others seem shocked by 'the accident'. If they only knew! If they only knew! But only I know it, know about IT. ... What have I done? What if I was wrong? What if <strong>Faltugios and Traks</strong> were innocent. No, no, I was right. They were in liege with IT.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Then it turns out, that Faltugios is actually alive? He whispers something at night...</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p><strong>Faltugios is alive</strong>!!! <strong>He sneaked into my room while I was sleeping and whispered something into my ears</strong>. I can't recall what. When I switched on the light, he was gone. Perhaps IT has saved him and granted him ghostly powers. Or was it his ghost? Has IT turned him into a ghost? I am so shaken, so tired. I don't understand. We have some apparatus that should prove effective against ghosts. Tomorrow, I will set some of them up. ... The others are eyeing me suspiciously. I know I look tired and act nervously but perhaps they know what I have done. Perhaps the ghost of Faltugios talked to them. <strong>Or he is truly alive</strong>.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Is IT whispering or is it Faltugios that whispers?</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p><strong>Yalahar is in uproar</strong>. I think the knowledge is spreading somehow, making things only worse. <strong>I have spoken to Tjule of the circle and he claimed to have no knowledge at all about my mission</strong>. What is happening here? Is it not the will of the circle what we are doing here but the work of a <strong>splinter group?</strong> Whatever!</p>

            <p>In the final parts, something strange happens with the captain.</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>If I could only concentrate better. But they are haunting me. It is not only him but also others. Or is it him taking other forms? Some faces of my past, some faces I don't even know. I see them in the corners of my eye, only to vanish when I look at them. ... <strong>They are after me. The ghosts and the others</strong>. I sent the scholars into the fish caves again and again but they do not die. They even brought me a living fishman as I requested. Now I have this creature here in my laboratory and it seems, it is eyeing me, too.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>While the rest of the crew wants to go back to Yalahar, the captain plants some explosives on the outbound ship.</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>I was horrified as the ship exploded shortly after it left. There were no survivors. But I had no choice. They forced me to do it. It was their fault, not mine. It is IT's fault.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
               <p>We are short of food. I will have to rely on eating dead experiments. ... <strong>Rehus</strong> was attacked and killed by one of his experiments today. My only concern upon learning this was that he might join the ghosts that haunt me. The captured fishmen seems to be mocking me, too. I know what he is thinking. He thinks that my experiments will fail, that I have been unsuitable to lead such an expedition at all. He seems motionless and untouched when I yell at him, but I know he is snickering when I leave. ... Failure after failure. ... No one here to take care of the machines. No one here. ... Tired. So tired. <strong>No idea what Hiona is doing. We rarely speak. I wish she had left with the others. No word from Yalahar. The others. They are dead, aren't they? Something with the ship.</strong></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Finally he loses his mind, and doesn't even care that he will die.</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>Hiona is gone. No idea when I last saw her. Was it yesterday? Has it been a week ago? A month? The fish-thing is gone, too. Its prison must have been cracked as I threw things at him in a fit of rage. Now I am alone? No, I have been alone since the beginning.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
               <p>I hope Faltugios or Ramiar take care of the labs for a while. ... Hungry. Where are the others? They left me? It's so hard to remember. So hard to concentrate. ... I am the creator of a new race. Does this make me a god? ... The others are dead I think. ... I create life and fight an evil entity for the fate of the world. I am the only sentient being on this world. ... I am alone and the guardian of the world. I am a god. A god does not have to explain his actions. A god knows no guilt. I know what's best. Yes, that's good. ... So many crawlers on the loose. They attacked me. Me, their creator! I will strike them down with my godly wrath and the chorus of ghosts that accompanies me will sing a hymn of my vengeance! All will die. I will cleanse this rotten world and create a new one! ... <strong>I am dying. They wounded me. But this is fine</strong>. When they can kill a god, they are strong enough. In the end I succeeded. But will the world not end when I die? I am the creator, the centre. Time will tell.</p>

            <blockquote>
               <p><strong>By analysing the very structure of the universe, their mago-scientists became aware of a 'missing factor' in all world-views, calculations and sciences.

            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
               <p>The Yalahari eventually managed to establish an 'approximation theory' of a place between reality and non-reality, a place that should not be. And that place was not void, but inhabited by one thing which our words could only feebly describe as an 'entity'. Knowing about the power of words, they gave it the name '<strong>Variphor</strong>'.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
               <p><strong>The Yalahari tried to understand and interact with Variphor</strong>, but soon their initial thrill was replaced with creeping fear. <strong>Variphor was perfectly aware of his existence and that of our universe, and his subtle influence seemed to be responsible for many dire and destructive things which happened in the past</strong>. Suddenly it also became shockingly clear to the Yalahari that by giving the entity a name, they had also given it some more substance in our universe.</p>

            <blockquote>
               <p>The horrified Yalahari tried to undo their actions, but it was too late - most of them had gained too deep an understanding of the things that were not supposed to be. <strong>Tainted with forbidden knowledge and unable to resist that influence, sisters and brothers turned against each other and in a night of slaughter</strong>, most of the once proud race was wiped out. The remaining Yalahari knew about their irreversible corruption and decided to part from this world.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>So we can basically figure out that the Yalaharian researchers found out about IT/Variphor, and were trying to make an army to destroy IT before IT destroyed them, but the knowledge of IT just made it worse.. feeding on their fear, causing more fear that eventually breaks you in a vicious cycle.</p>
            <p>What did the Yalahari do?</p>
            <p>They created the Lightbearers, whose sole purpose is to fight Variphor.<br>
               To spread the light, to stop the corruption.

            <p>Eventually, a catastrophe happened, and the Yalahari fled.. where did they go?</p>
            <p>There is a single snakeman that doesn't use Z's, and he is the only one I found to worship a great serpent. All others worship a snake or dragon.  (two NPC with S has since been added to Marapur but I cannot speak to them)</p>

               <p>Navigator: I was once captain of a ship, the Skyflare. <strong>We were traders for King Tibianus</strong> and on our way home when we got into <strong>a storm</strong>. We fought hard to escape the cold grip of the sea. ...<br>
                  Navigator: When none of my men returned, I forced myself to make a decision. Either <strong>dying on this dead ship or plunging into the liquid black beneath</strong>. ...<br>
                  Navigator: In my desperation my thoughts fell onto a <strong>strange armor</strong> - <strong>a gift from a trader we dealt with just before the storm</strong>. Strange ornaments and fish-like elements decorated this armor. We thought it would fit just perfectly into the captain's cabin. ...<br>
                  Navigator: <strong>He said something like a 'blessed breath' and 'to subdue the drift'</strong>. We thought he wanted to sell us worthless decoration and make it look interesting. If I had only listened to what he said. ...

                  Navigator: I dived into the deep black. Across rugged mountains, vast fields of kelp, swarms of strange fish. ...<br>
                  Navigator: <strong>And then I laid my eyes on a creature I have never seen before. I now know that they call themselves Njey. You would call them the 'Creatures of the Deep' or 'Deeplings'.</strong> ...<br>
                  Navigator: <strong>I am now convinced that when they first saw me descending in that suit with the light of the shimmer glower encompassing me, they took me for their God King Qjell</strong>. And that's when it all started to make sense. Don't you agree?

               <li>Was given a strange armor from someone who somehow knew how to subdue the drift and could breathe underwater.</li>
               <li>He was the captain, yet calls himself the Navigator numerous times.</li>
               <li>He calims he is from Thais, yet has an ornamented carpet and a house built of zteel.</li>
               <li>He has a 469 machine, and steelwork that is only made by Yalaharian Golems.</li>
               <li>He has a SHIMMER GLOWER, which can only be made with <strong>eyes of deeplings</strong>.........</li>
               <li>He actually responds to the keyword LAGATOS!</li>

            <p>And I also think that Navigator = Lagatos, likely also Faltugios.</p>
            <p>When we first met him, we use gold on a huge golden anchor, which resonates a tune that teleports us exactly 45 degrees southeast. This small golden anchor somehow ended up in the brood of the deeplings, I am guessing the Navigator has been there, corrupting.. shaping the unborn in dreams.. Working from the shadows, amplifying his voice through the dream machine.</p>
            <p>You see all those stones up there?</p>

            <blockquote>
               <p>And when the Swimmer reached the bottom of the sea, he was enlightened by the beauty of the deep. They did not see a foreigner nor a stranger, <strong>not a visitor but a threat</strong>.</p>

            <blockquote>
               <p><strong>Held captive for two lifetimes he became one with the stone and coral that bound him</strong>. He longed for the world above. Wandering the skies again in broad daylight. Roaming the deserts, mountains and vast plains of the world like he used to. Floating a drop above the rain and dodging beams of the twin suns, he would embrace the disembodied freedom of his true self.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Wandering the skies? Floating a drop above the rain?<br>

            <blockquote>
               <p>He was a <strong>spirit and a ghost</strong>. <strong>His soul moved into the very walls and fences of every house and court</strong>. Claiming the very foundations of this watery city as his own.</p>
               <p>The Swimmer now lingers in <strong>shadowy corners</strong>, damp and dark and hollow. Chasing flickers of light touching the ground like a cat born of fog. When the creatures of the deep fell for the first visitor, he mourned the loss of the good in their souls. When the colour finally fled from its last enclave, he longed for redemption.</p>

            <p>What is left of the light once brought to us, what remains of the fires once thriving us, it is he.</p>

               However, with some crossreferencing of the dictionaries, we find that the language has <strong>evolved</strong>.  Some syllables and consonants have been exchanged. These books also seem quite long and.. 'intellectual', perhaps this was some time after the First Coming, and before Lagatos?

            <p>It's interesting how there's been a shift in the language, the texts after the first coming were written in a younger tongue - and now we have an older tongue.</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>The Book of Qjell, <strong>The Second Coming</strong></p>
               <p>Edition II, Translation from 'Jekhr' (language of the Deeplings)<br>
                  By Lagatos, Chronicler and Scholar
               </p>
               <p>Note: <strong>The texts I discovered that deal with the time after the First Coming seem to be in a younger tongue and written entirely different from the older works. The newer passages are more like chants to be recited and memorised</strong>.</p>
               <p>And Qjell rose and brought light.<br>
                  And Qjell conquered and became light.<br>
                  And we awaited the return of our God King Qjell.<br>
                  And in the darkest of nights,<br>
                  in the twin sun's nadir,<br>
                  their touch fading from the ocean's bed,<br>
                  He returned.

               <p>This time shall be known as the Second Coming.</p>
               <p>And Qjell spread word of the light.<br>
                  And Qjell pointed upward beyond.<br>
                  And Qjell united us to obey.<br>

            <p>So the language is evolving. It also looks like, the language became chanty. Sea shanty if you will. (sorry)</p>
            <p>We can find that the book of SENX uses very similar Jekhr that the lying Lagatos, I mean Faltugios- sorry.. the Navigator uses..</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Navigator: 8O'''' |(( JT(|W-T -( J-T =|- (CW- BO:</li>
               <li>GO ILL JHLIMEH EL JEH FIE LUME RO?</li>
               <li>go ill jaalimeaa el jeaa fie lume ro?</li>
               <li>GO ILL seabed when/if the/that/this light reach not/non believer/not obeying?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>ILL is pronounced very similarly to YILL, which means colour in our dictionary.</p>
            <p>Gonn = what<br>
               GO = which?
            </p>
            <p>So the navigator asks:</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>Which colour is the seabed when light does not reach it?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Answer is flou, or black.</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>Navigator: QJELL AFAR GOU JEY!<br>

            <p>And according to the swimmer, he was trapped for some centuries before his control. Could he be Senx?<br>
               Chasing flickers of light, hiding in the shadows - As described by the paranoid Captain experience after 'killing' Lagatos.
            </p>
            <p>But.. there's something really strange with Jekhr.</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Jekhr became chanty, and way simpler after their grotesquification</li>
               <li>Jekhr looks funny when written</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
               <li>Their english is broken, yet they know it (subdue the drift, blessed breath guy taught them?)</li>
               <li>This also shows us that J is inserted pretty much everywhere possible, J is one of the most common letters in Jekhr.</li>
               <li>Jekhr is nuanced with infinite verbs.. like gharonk..?</li>
               <li>The language contains a ton of H characters and 'a's, like another book we find in SERPENTINE tower...</li>
            </ul>
            <p>At this point, I am just wondering, why do we even have some odd 7 languages in Tibia?<br>
               Staring at the pronounced translations for days, scouring as much lore as I could and reading tons of names and books, I just couldn't shake the feeling that... there might not be seven different languages... there may just be one... they all seem so, simular somehow..

               There are strong indications of elves living amongst humans at some point in Ankrahmun, but I won't make this too long. Our chanty book from Ankrahmun is enough for now.
            </p>
            <p>One commonality is that there is an extreme abundance of the letter 'A'.<br>
               This also holds true for all the Djinn names, all the previous Pharaoh, and especially the cavemen.. every single one.  While it's true for english and many other languages, it's not common in this abundance combined with other vowels. However, with some biased transposition, we can make 'A' in abundance.

            <p>I did collect every language of Tibia and most instances of them from Cavemen ugha language to Chakoya, transposed them, did frequency analysis of characters.. and I found that there are similarities in the top 7 characters, enough that <em>enough</em> suspicion arose.  I tried many other languages unrelated to eachother, such as Finnish, French, English.. but even after transposition and frequency analysis, the characters are completely different to eachother. Not at all as close as the Tibian languages are to each-other.<br>
               BUT, knowing that there are always answers in the lore, and knowing that the language has evolved with time, made frequency analysis not as useful. So I kept trucking on with more confidence.

            <p>The deepling word for <strong>weapon</strong>? nakk, (or Naxx in another tongue we saw earlier).</p>
            <p>The deepling word for <strong>armed</strong>? tanakk! (or tanaxx in another tongue we saw earlier).</p>
            <p><strong>He sound our war drums</strong>! That were name come from. <em>Tanakk</em>! <em>Tanakk</em>!</p>
            <p>That is, three different and connected places- using very similar words with the same meaning.</p>
            <p>My spidey senses were tingling when we find the meaning of Tatak, and I had remembered a similar word in Jekhr..<br>
               Why would they give us the meaning of the word 'war drums', 'arm up for battle!'? That's what I tried to explain and that's how I came across this.
            </p>
            <p>Why do we have English? One explanation I reasoned is that the priests did not want to share their knowledge to the commonfolk, to not spill the secrets that might come around and bite them in their arse.<br>
               They likely want to protect and hold this knowledge for themselves, any prying or scrying ears might be listening...  or challenge their titles as priests.
            </p>
            <p>BUT! ARE THE HUMANS OLDER THAN THE ELVES??????</p>
            <p>Yes!</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>I witnessed Ss'rar making his move on ascension to become the serpent god. <strong>I watched the first elves struggling to form a nation with the help of the lightbearers</strong>. It was me who assisted the great calculator to assemble the bonelords language. And you come here to this mountain and ask me how to win the heart of some shepherdess? This world has become a ridiculous mockery.</p>

            <p>And!</p>
            <p>LIGHTBEARER BRINGER LIGHT!</p>
            <p>The joy I felt, underscribable. Tantalizing questions. I've read that book close to a hundred times yet that detail eluded me, only really thought of it now while writing.  Always assumed that the Yalahari were mostly elves.</p>
            <p>OK. Maybe we can translate more words, I don't know. Probably not too much, maybe something more.</p>
            <p>It's also completely reasonable, if you think about it.. we have strange glyphs.. these are found all over the world, The Others - outcasts were a mix of races - why would the languages be completely different? Legend goes that The Others / Zathroth created the Djinn.</p>
            <p>It's also a great plot device for the content creators, as they likely didn't intend for the language to be completely translatable. It's a way for them to still make it understandable and &quot;solveable&quot;, while still giving us the reason why it can't be translated. It was never intended to. But we can use this to get further in the lore, and we will use it to understand 469.</p>

            <p>We have followed quite heavy new lore all over the place and answered many but far from all mysteries they hold.</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Yalaharians quest for knowledge and their ultimate demise by schemes and oppression.</li>
               <li>The deeplings quest for enlightement and worship, and their ultimate demise of oppression, twice.</li>
               <li>We've made some extremely confusing bits of lore a bit more manageable, such as:</li>
               <li>The confusing clusterf* of fishlore that somehow answers three of the most pressing questions in lore.</li>
               <li>The &quot;demon language&quot;</li>
               <li>The origin of the elves</li>
               <li>Glyphs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We also know</p>
            <ul>
               <li>The origin of the humans</li>
               <li>The bases of the ancients and their teleports</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And the appearance of several deeplings and deepling idols in Optical Coordinating sphere quest suddenly makes sense. ;)</p>
