            <p>One of the formula we found is a 'tridiag' formula.<br>
               This could be a tridiagonal matrix, like this

            <p>When following the magic web, I stumbled upon these formulae in Drefia that lands on a 'gate' - In a great stoke of coincidence, these were brought to my attention by Besd Tesd as I was analyzing pieces of the map-puzzle.</p>
            <p><img src="_resources/b7bbed0591024752a21bde9efe8f270e.png" alt="95be1ab6e1aab5db8f1632f9b6cadcff.png"></p>
            <p>I am going to visualize them, and they all seem related when reading the 'easy'-to-understand first-half of the formulae.</p>

            <p>Ok, so in essence, we have three formula that are kinda similar to what we see earlier</p>
            <ol>
               <li>Area of a triangle (Tridiag(onal matrix) formula?) Tiriagonal matrixes are commonly used to create triangles.</li>
               <li>Dot product of two vectors could look like this (4,3,1,5,3).(3,4,7,8,4) = 88... And the dot product is used to calculate the area of a parallelogram...</li>
               <li>We have points in a two-dimensional space, just like the Dianscher coordinates.</li>
            </ol>
            <blockquote>
               <p>Note: g stands for gate, g [a_,x_] for the <strong>coordinates</strong> of the gate in the <strong>2-dimensional-area</strong> and e for the strengh of the magic energy that flows into this gate.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The spidey senses were too much at this point - considering the brief explanations of the formulae found in both Drefia and Demona...</p>
            <p>But okay, we have some hints towards an area of a triangle.<br>
               On a <em>two dimensional matrix</em> we could calculate an <em>area</em> if we had <em>three points</em>, as many corners there are in a triangle.
            </p>
            <p>The Dianscher coordinates p3,q9,0o and p3,23,0t. are three points each.<br>
               --------------------------------------1--2--3 ---------1--2--3
            </p>
            <p>But you remember we couldn't get the coordinates to fit, let alone 3.<br>
               So I had some hope but it felt like complete madness.<br>
               I tried for some odd 6 hours before I could join several clues into something that actually could make sense but still borderline insanity.<br>
               I created maps and wrote and plotted and thought, walked in circles, thought some more and plotted until iteration 20 when all most pieces and formulae came together into a reasonable system.
            </p>
            <p><img src="_resources/765cbbb582044c189fc76da3867ff0df.png" alt="263b6486ea3803ae304c8e9bf97781e5.png"></p>
            <p>The map looks creased in the upper right corner, so I mirrored it ;).<br>
               And would you look at that, it goes all the way to Z and both sets of coordinates make a perfect triangle in the same area. Isn't that incredible.
            </p>
            <p>A refined, maybe correct version:</p>
            <p><img src="_resources/50efaf690b8343c5b0b1f12a9e8689bf.png" alt="03f9bef13321783c293ab2218104fd83.png"></p>
            <h3 id="p3q90o-and-p3230t">p3,q9,0o and p3,23,0t</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>P3 is like we saw in the third formula, so first coordinate is P3, <strong>x</strong> → so 3 steps east from (P,P).</li>
               <li>Q9 is then not the x direction but the <strong>y</strong> ↑ direction, nine steps north of (Q,Q).</li>
               <li>This follows the rule of vectors we saw in formula 3 earlier, x then y ( → then ↑ )</li>
               <li>0t could mean theta or gamma, there is another coordinate where the number is on the left side - and that number is also the last number of the coordinate set (0o = (O,O)?). but is that all it means? are they angles? or are they points?  the angle between 0o and 0t is 45 degrees.</li>
               <li>23 Fits great if it's (23,23) where the number is counted without using the alphabet.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Now funny thoughts such as triangle of terror, triangle tower starts to become a bit suspicious and my sanity is slowly getting a bit better.</p>
            <p>My doubts vanished when I noticed</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>Coordinates for the <strong>area around</strong> Dianscher<br>

            <p>And it's even written by the same guy that wrote the book on honeminas formula!</p>
            <p>Ok, we are definitely onto something Knightmare made and really really wanted to hide.<br>
               Maybe the coordinates could be used somehow to even decipher 469.
            </p>
            <p>Now, I felt I had to construct the Magic Web and check every spot on the map and try to understand what it could possibly mean and what the heck they could possibly try to tell us and what the heck we could possibly learn from this. Just because I kinda miss the state of complete madness.</p>
            <p>To add some extra spice to the madness, we can figure out that Tibia is round.</p>

            <p>See also how upper Zao is so close to Banuta, from a book found in Zao:</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>In the year 21 of the reign of Tzuzak VII,<br>
                  It seemed as if the plague had clouded the minds of our people. Instead of fighting the common enemy, certain elements conspired against the king and each other. Without unified resistance of our weakened forces, the end of civilisation seemed inevitable. But some lizardmen who no longer listened to the lies of the prophets who believed in false gods started to pray for salvation. And even though they were only a few, they were heard. <strong>Our saviours came from the north</strong>. They abandoned the paradise that they had ruled to save our kin. <strong>On mighty wings</strong> they came with the north wind. Their wrath was like fire, they crushed our opponents and sowed fear into their vile hearts. They gathered our troops and led them from victory to victory. They blessed the lizards of true heart and led those lost in the darkness of lies to the light of truth. Those who refused to see the truth were eradicated by cleansing fire. ...

            <blockquote>
               <p>Player: ley<br>
                  Milos: Most Tibian cultures have some knowledge about those <strong>straight lines that run across the landscape</strong>, connecting both, natural and sacred sites. Some also call them <strong>‘fairy paths’ or ‘spirit lines’</strong>. …<br>
                  Milos: As far as I know, in Zao they are called ‘dragon lines’. <strong>Markers connecting the ley lines can be mounds, cairns, standing stones, stone circles, ponds, wells, shrines, temples or cross-roads</strong>.
               </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Let's see if it holds up:</p>
            <p><img src="_resources/30365055c5ba471581967c94c5f29f4c.png" alt="Magic Web 469 - Page 8 (2).png"></p>
            <p>It does! We just found a lot more and the system to it.</p>
            <p>Now we are going into the really spooky zone of consisteny by the content team...</p>
            <p>Take your time to view this picture - In the center we have our Thais dream machine, and then in equal distances from the center we have 8 gates which are <em>particularly</em> interesting..</p>

            <p>And here we got loads of beds, towers, teleporters.. bonelords, stonecircles and even this map. All of the 9 gates are related to death.</p>
            <p>Bounac ship, where galthen tried to discover all ancient magic..</p>
            <p>There is another instance of this map in Zathroth secret library, and someone has scribbled a lot of Z on it. Crazy huh?</p>

            <p>Another thing I found while researching the lore of Kilmaresh, is the same map.</p>
            <p><img src="_resources/0ee2e738c7f5412ab4c47a93686392b7.png" alt="Blank diagram - Page 1 (1).png"></p>
            <p>We find the map in ancient ruins of Fafnar the feisty &amp; fiery sister of Suon.<br>
               The explorers society representative there claims it is a map of the area Kilmaresh, so I tried it..

            <p>While on the prowl for clues, I found that there is a raid happening on the X, sometimes a pirate ship has crashed there, sometimes there are just pirates there and sometimes there are no pirates there at all. This is an unannounced raid and not much info on it can be found.</p>
            <p><img src="_resources/f8acdd2c110d41b3a53a9a9e1398c24f.png" alt="f23680ae823a3a19243f72262442da99.png"></p>

            <p>Sunken City, where Thais dream machine used to be anchored on the map.<br>
               <img src="_resources/f5b46e609c364e48b7be94aa891c1fab.png" alt="e42a7267cc9fac2e52212e31ca61c987.png">

            <p>Do you see that? Anchoring some 2 degrees northwest of the 15th latitude of Fafnar. In front of a Celestial map.</p>
            <p>We are missing something key, what is 15th latitude of Fafnar?</p>
            <p>I was so scared about this because it could just break this whole theory.<br>
               But when thinking about it, the 'central point' in the web is too uncanny, and there's even a chest of gold on the X when the pirates have crashed...
            </p>
            <p>And that's when it hit me, using the exact same system we had applied to eastern Thais...</p>
            <p>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15<br>

            <p>(degrees are still 'legal', 90 vs 45, works in a compass)</p>
            <p>The pirates must've come from the north-east considering they just visited Port hope, and they are anchoring at the only safe place to anchor.<br>
               This should be the reason that some days the pirates are on land but the ship cannot be seen.<br>
               It is also one of a couple of places where pirates could hide and stay safe from the winds and waves.<br>
               Hiding from both ogres and minotaurs.<br>
               It's the perfect spot.
            </p>
            <p>So it seems like they made another way into 469 as the old one had been missed for so long and really difficult.</p>
            <p>Now we have</p>
            <ul>
               <li>One map which at the time was an unique quest reward from the shrouded Demona.</li>
               <li>A way of placing map-on-map on two different places in Tibia</li>
               <li>At least five hints towards the map being important in closely related places</li>
               <li>A reasonable system</li>
               <li>Two different places using our reasonable system</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While it could be strange with the map working on two places, we find it is actually reasonable - 469 has been unexplained for some 22~ years since it was added, maybe it was too difficult? And why would they make a map in 2001 just to plan to use it for Kilmaresh in 2015 which only made the discovery stronger and the rush of dopamine and confirmation had me crying tears of joy.</p>
            <p>Both places being of utmost importance. Do you know what's beneath the X? A certain optiCOMPASS from Mysterious Ornate Chest quest that we all know to be the most complex quest that Cipsoft released, it took around a decade for that quest to get to the state it is in now.</p>
            <p>This is when we have to back up a little bit and look at the why. Having coordinates alone won't explain everything, and now when we have so many new potential teleports where the ancients could've been, we have a crucial key that we can use to explain the missing bits required to understand the history of the ancients, and only after that - 469.</p>
            <p>If you enjoyed the article so far and have not taken a break, do.<br>
               Next parts are a bit more lore but I will try to not make it heavy, please be attentive and try read, think and follow along.<br>
               The lore is f-ing amazing and filled with riddles, one of which was extremely tricky but the answer had me in complete disbelief.

            <p>Now we can now connect multiple places to something.. central. Let's!</p>
            <h1 id="serpentine-tower">Serpentine Tower</h1>

            <p>Serpentine tower is interesting to look at because it's an astrology and magic-center, which were very important to the Pharaoh.<br>
               Since we've seen some indication of 469 being about astrology, it's extra exciting to revisit this tower.
            </p>

            <p>A place which has multiple components of what we've been looking at is Draconia.</p>

            <p>If you remember, Draconia is a gate. In it we find traces of what we've been looking at, bonelord shield is there and a star amulet as well. Many things we saw in Demona.</p>

                  We lost <strong>three mages</strong> in our last attempt at performing a controlled demon summoning. It is still too difficult to predict in what way the fabric of time and space is affected by the breach of the sphere, and from what we have seen the backlash of nature against demonic incursion can range from a slightly offensive odour to a sizeable explosion such as the one we saw yesterday.

                  The 'stoneskin' spell is still flawed. The test subjects complained about severe problems when moving, and some actually suffered from <strong>partial paralysis</strong> or even from acute petrification! However, I still believe the spell might be useful as some sort of emergency measure because I imagine that turning oneself into a statue for a while might come in handy when all other options have failed. <strong>Oddly enough it is quite simple to focus the spell into an object, preferably an amulet</strong>, so the change is still bound to an object that serves as a transmitter.

Once this has been accomplished we will finally be able to <strong>see in the dark</strong> without attracting unwanted attention. The problem is to stabilise the spell so it can be maintained during a predictable period of time. Also, <strong>the hurtful effect of sudden light to the spell caster</strong> must be palliated.

There are numerous problems, though, and it is well possible that we have to start all over again. This would mean, of course, that we would have to create some spells to obtain information by means of magic which is plain to see <strong>when you are close to the targeted person</strong>.

            </p>
            <p>There is another book in Serpentine Tower that seems related:</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>The Larokhon are <strong>entities made up entirely of wind and of heat</strong>. They appear to be nothing but mere blurs in the sand, and those who are unfortunate enough to see them believe their eyes just played tricks on them. But then, the Larokhon are rarely ever seen by mortals since <strong>they shun daylight</strong>. They prefer those twilight moments when there is still some warmth left from a scorching day although <strong>night</strong> has clearly fallen. This is the time when the Larokhons' move from their secret hideouts to <strong>prey on unwary dreamers that are haunted by nightmares</strong>. Their sense of smelling fear is infallible, and once they have found their prey a mere crack in a wall is large enough for them to enter. Once they are close to their victims they feast on their innermost fears, evoking images of horror and despair that are so horrible that they often cause the dreamer's death. So take this word of warning, traveller: Beware the nights that are hot and windless, for a mere breeze of hot air may cause your demise.</p>

The study of astrology is pointing at further influences that go well beyond summoning creatures, though. For instance, <strong>the influence of the stars and the suns seems to increase with the power level of the performed incantation or ritual</strong>.

                  ....<br>
                  Considering their abilities, it is obvious that the UMOs are somehow connected to the magic forces. Furthermore, the UMOs seem to be <strong>entities</strong> rather than vehicles or something like that.<br>
                  ...<br>
                  <strong>The more we ask for answers, the more silence we find</strong>. Is this evidence that infiltration is real and that the minions of the UMOs are amongst us? I think, yes it is! Be aware! <strong>Always look up to the sky when it's dark</strong>!
