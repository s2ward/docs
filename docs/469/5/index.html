            <p>Let's tie up some loose ends.</p>
            <p>The cranky crone is bound, extremely old &amp; at first impression - seems to have a bad memory.<br>
               However, has some vivid memories.

            <p>We hear another mention of the Catastrophe, and apparently the northen area had wonderful gardens and the waters were clean.</p>
            <p>We can give the Cranky Crone a Jade hat, and when doing so, we hear a small detail that changes everything we knew about northern Zao.</p>

            <p>Just like Durin!</p>
            <p>Detouring back to the Sunken Quarter, we can make some more sense of our surroundings.</p>
            <p>What do you think these could be? Wretched many-eyed horrors? Shadows?</p>
            <p><img src="_resources/60dc57aa2ef24ebf996949db7dc76533.png" alt="da2e51c79858aca6f97f243a74d0b0d8.png"></p>
            <p>Brandon is bound and controlls the currents of Sunken city<br>
               What happened to Brandon?
            </p>

            <p>Nothing good to say the least.<br>
               A hundred cold, slimy tentecles, sounds way more than some serpents would have.
            </p>

               <p>Mr Brandon: Urgh... the... THINGS. <strong>I can't forget their horrible sight</strong>.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>I'm <em>guessing</em> the statues are our ancient wretched many-eyed horrible thingz. Ancient bonelords.</p>
            <p>Through the hidden keywords 'currents' and 'protected', I found that there is an <em>other</em> guardian of the seas, not one but two of them, could it be IT? Or the fire-feathered serpent?  Or an ancient bonelord?</p>
            <p><img src="_resources/a14dc92e9dc34ae7a8a5071be6e1761c.png" alt="bb1789fe0ff96f11ef8b88153c8c19c2.png"></p>

            <p>But I have lied.<br>
               When I said that we could connect everthing to something central?<br>
               Then I showed you the Serpentine Tower.<br>
               That was sort of a lie.<br>
               There is something <em>much</em> <em>much</em> more central, and even more relevant, now that we posess the knowledge to tackle one of if not <em>the</em> most cryptic place in Tibia, Roshamuul.
            </p>
            <p>In the center of Roshamuul, we find the most powerful artifact of otherkind, protected by arguably the strongest monster in all of Tibia, which happens to be tentacled.</p>
            <p>Sometimes 400 tibians die without killing it.</p>
            <p><img src="_resources/598e653c8a7740d99342081346e20965.png" alt="21f1a6bfc7e0e87ec793a2a93a6ae8d2.png"></p>

            <p>Just how central is it?</p>
            <p><img src="_resources/3c9c36f6c25046d0a013e6796d6e94e1.png" alt="article 469 - rosh (1).png"></p>
            <p>Aah, the Heart of Midnight. How does he know?</p>
            <p><img src="_resources/39d87fb21e954049808b3c49a4c0f6a7.png" alt="567295e7d9f98b44cce2469feaf5e327.png"></p>
            <p>With a somewhat blurry memory, he was on his way north - it looks like they are cataloguing various items found throughout Roshamuul.</p>
            <p>In a quest with Morax, we are to bring him tea, and sleep in his bed.</p>
            <p>This leads us to their cistern, which looks like a dream teleporter machine.</p>
            <p><img src="_resources/2a19c3a2ceb74814a0052237900c94ab.png" alt="82bda3508abca034715768b7b1ed7031.png"></p>
            <p>And in the corner, we can even see something.<br>
               <img src="_resources/2f56ec4668524cdbbf240355bf64ef70.png" alt="02329b258f38ce2ab68e7502a567f0fe.png">
            </p>
            <p>Same thing we find in Morax's dream.<br>
               But do you see that? There is an item that disappears.. i'm talking about the small golden taboret.
            </p>
            <p><img src="_resources/3cc41944b1fa43afbe919aa9281e268f.gif" alt="rosh.gif"></p>
            <p>This coincides with Morax cataloguing items and the effing Inquisition making this 5000x harder for us.<br>
               We can also see that Morax started to repair his house in two different places.. and is decorating it - completely disregarding his mission.<br>
               When asked about Sandomo or Henricus of the inquisition, Morax doesn't even remember them.
            </p>
            <p>It's like he wants to rebuild &quot;his&quot; home.</p>
            <p><img src="_resources/86d8bfc5609d41ed80710c988e62470f.png" alt="8d883676d333ca0d4b6812344f1f981e.png"></p>
            <p>These are thin hints, but it's enough to say that the others were from here and what kind of capabilities they had.<br>
               golden taboret is Ankrahmunian and Rathletonian.<br>
               Morax likely got some Essence of Wishful thinking, wishing to see Roshamuul in it's former glory.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>Player: Essence of Wishful Thinking<br>
                  Morax: Purest essence… very powerful… addictive… steers thoughts and enslaves …<br>
                  Morax: <em>mumble</em> … used in the great war to deflect… <em>mumble</em> … our doom… <em>sigh</em><br>
                  Player: Essence of Dread<br>

            </blockquote>
            <p>Ring of wishes?</p>
            <p>For a small but extremely important detour to Rathleton:</p>
            <p>Beneath the Glooth Factory, we learn that these mysterious machines are actually 'glooth data machines'</p>
            <p><img src="_resources/719becfa85494fb5967e60d590c356d2.png" alt="c57275bfbe63cf1585d57215bc73416a.png"></p>
            <p>--- ALERT--- 0001110010110011001 --- ALERT ---</p>
            <p>Why is this important?</p>
            <p>I found some books in the glooth factory.</p>
            <p><img src="_resources/fe6f0c13717e4f0591f3b5f7f802bf23.png" alt="34748962e5957f60934d095ab041b749.png"></p>

            <p>It's funny that they lose their clothes, likely why they go invisible. Imagine that, naked others sneaking around.<br>
               Spoopy ghosts.
            </p>
            <p>It's highly likely that the power of slime and energy is a catalyst for teleportation, amongst others. This is likely the main purpose Oramond/Rathleton had for the ancients. Slime.</p>
            <p><img src="_resources/aaff094d197144e0a213e2aa924f3a60.gif" alt="slimeenergy.gif"></p>
            <p>Bozo gives us a whoopie cushion, and in Gloud Ship quest we use glooth to fly in a 'ship' using balloonery, go figure. Sky Isles Inc?</p>
            <p>ONE DAY YOU WILL SEE THAT I'M NOT CRAZY! YOU WILL SEE FROM YOU WONDERFUL PARADISE IN HEAVEN!</p>

            <p>Moving on, I found one single instance of a remnant 'other' talking otherian.</p>

            </blockquote>
            <p>The inhabitants of Roshamuul seemingly used glooth for their dreamy purposes.</p>
            <p>So the history of ancients, goes something like this:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Humans in Zao and Tiquanda evolved</li>
               <li>They managed to control the powers of dreams, and could create new beings</li>
               <li>They used snakes, salamanders, frogs, create 'lizards', which are really 'snakemen'/'salamanders'. They also created dworcs, minotaurs..</li>
               <li>They enslaved and created many-eyed horrors.</li>
               <li>Learnt their ways</li>
               <li>They studied science, philosophy, arts</li>
               <li>Were able to fly on the howling winds, which there are plenty of in Svargrond and Nargor - every heard about Chyll? Or the Howling winds of Nargor?  Weskurt?</li>
               <li>Journied far and wide, met with and met with the deeplings/first elves  (Fiehonja is EXTREMELY close to ZAO)</li>
               <li>Some went different ways, constructed Yalahar</li>
               <li>While others and the first elves inhabited the Ankrahmun/Roshamuul/Kilmaresh/Non-shattered isles area.</li>
               <li>Combined the powers of glooth and slime to construct machines.</li>
               <li>Mastered teleportation and the magic web</li>
               <li>Built the Heart of Midnight on the center of the magic web, where the energies are immense.</li>
               <li>They constructed the Dream Catcher</li>
               <li>Built towers and places of importance all over Tibia and its gates.</li>
               <li>A thing, IT, Variphor started clouding the minds all over Tibia.</li>
               <li>Yalaharians went all over the world to try to combat Variphor, the Lightbearers.</li>
               <li>Some of them fled to Beregar and became dwarves (that eventually moved to kazordoon and finally the surface)</li>
               <li>After the catastrophe, dragon emperors started ruling Zao, using their 'web of the dragon kingz'</li>
               <li>1000 years ago, Princess Ramora triggered the exodus of humans, likely the same exodus we read about in Ankrahmun, Banor.</li>
               <li>The isles shattered and the web is in chaotic disarray</li>
               <li>Now, in 1000 p.g. (post genesis) we still feel Variphor all over the world...</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is not the full picture, there are many more components to the story and this list might not be entirely accurate. It's merely for your recollection.</p>
            <h1 id="the-catastrophe">The Catastrophe</h1>
            <p>Time to read a witness of the catastrophe, and a minion of Zathroth.<br>
               These books gives me the shivers every time. I recommend you to read <a data-from-md title='https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/Roshamuul_Libraries#Roshamuul' href='https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/Roshamuul_Libraries#Roshamuul'>them</a>. Everything I have shown you so far is for you to be able to fully understand these books and what comes after.<br>
               For the sake of the length of the article, I will show some excerpts.
            </p>
            <p>Please take another break, now comes the grand finale. Immerse yourself. Take your time, you only get one shot at understanding <em>everything</em> for the first time.</p>

            <blockquote>
               <p>With <strong>stolen life-force and dreams</strong> I prolonged my life for so long that I often cannot tell what really happened and what I might have imagined, or what is a lie told so often and casually that I forgot the truth.</p>
               <p>I write this down in <strong>the tongue of the gods</strong>, hoping that their vanity alone is enough to ensure that this gift to their followers be preserved.</p>
               <p>I write this down on mere paper instead of using the <strong>dream crystals</strong> of my people. This way it might escape the <strong>watchful eyes of my colleagues</strong> long enough to outlive them.<br>
                  Much could be told about my people. It would fill volumes and yet only scratch the surface. But this is nothing I could accomplish at all, and nothing I'd even care to try. If I am right, my people will be dead soon enough and just another side note of history.
               </p>
               <p>First of all, <strong>the name of my people is nothing meant for vocal chords</strong>. It is a thought pattern, half a dream and untranslatable into any tongue. <strong>As is the language we use with our own people</strong>. It was a <strong>hard thing to learn to communicate with others</strong>. It is somewhat disgusting , <strong>having to rely on grunting and gasping to communicate with our allies</strong>. The latter gave us many names, rarely though to flatter us. <strong>Dreamstealers, dreamvampires, dreamshapers</strong> and so many, many more that I've forgotten them. Most of the times I preferred to refer to us simply as <strong>the dreamers</strong>.</p>

            <p>As we've seen throughout, many-eyed horrorz (bonelords) were enslaved by the Zathrothian league.<br>

               <p><strong>My people were always proud and cruel</strong>. Not entirely inhabitants of this world; only the passing to and fro other realms was always natural for us. We were no great warriors, but we served in our own ways in the god wars. In the service of the gods, <strong>we helped those allied to Zathroth</strong>. We were spies, messengers, advisors; and we manufactured weapons of war in our own, special way. <strong>I was one of the first. A leader, a priest, a prophet</strong>. Yet I always let others do the outstanding things. I fancied pulling strings and being the secret initiator of many things; but I'm not sure now how much of this is true or some kind of paltry excuse I convinced myself to believe. <strong>All the great achievements of our race were initiated by others</strong>. But I have been there, and outlived them all. Early on, my people developed a <strong>mastery of dream, unparalleled before</strong>. <strong>We shaped dreams, and dragged them into reality</strong>. We constructed dreams, with the only purpose to use them as facilities to <strong>forge other dreams in them</strong>. The concept has become so natural and trivial to me that it is hard to explain. It is like explaining colours to a blind man.</p>

            <blockquote>
               <p>Suffice it to say that we used dreams, both self-made and stolen, to shape the world and provide us with shelter, sustenance, tools and weapons. <strong>Dreams soon became the currency and life blood of our society</strong>. We were never numerous though, and managed to convince the leaders of our side that we were too valuable to be wasted on the battlefield. So we dwelled in our city made of stolen dreams, and schemed. Sometimes against our mutual foe, sometimes against our allies, and sometimes within our own. For several centuries this kept me occupied and entertained. <strong>We built the great dream catcher</strong>, our greatest accomplishment. A monument of our power.</p>

               <p>A short while ago, the council was approached with the request that we use the arts of our race to construct something entirely new: <strong>a prison made of dreams, using the veils and barriers of other worlds to dampen the power of all creatures</strong>, and lock them in and torture them for all eternity. We did not question this request. <strong>It was much too tempting to grow even more powerful, and so we consented. Little did we know that everything was staged and we were purposely misled</strong>.<br>
                  My people dived into this new venture with ambition. Resources were sent by other races, even knowledge was reluctantly shared by them. Prisoners and renegades were sent to us to do tests and experiments with them. Little of what we requested was ever denied. Even I was mildly thrilled for a while by the sheer novelty of the enterprise.

               <p>Then strange things began to happen. <strong>Plans were slightly changed, requests added to projects and the advisors led certain researches onto different paths that were not agreed upon</strong>. I would not have lived that long if I had not developed a sense for things going amiss. It became more and more obvious that we were not aware of the full truth. <strong>The increase of power levels for the prisons, for example, had, step by step, risen enormously. These were no longer prisons meant for some minor captives - these prisons were powerful enough to even give a lesser god some trouble. And there was more. Additions brought in by other races, things we did not even understand, were added. More and more demon 'advisors' stayed in the city all the while we heard about an increased fierceness of the battles elsewhere. I knew something big was happening. I was just undecided what to do with the knowledge</strong>.<br>
                  ..<br>
                  Soon I was more and more convinced that I was right; and when some of the demons approached us for a secret meeting, I was only mildly curious about what might be revealed. However, I can't tell what happened then and there. Gods were involved and binding vows were spoken, so that even now I can't go into details. I can merely circumvent it through stating that most of the secret things spoken about have already happened by now and are common knowledge.<br>
                  I had been right that the prison was more than just that. <strong>It was meant to be a trap. And it was meant not primarily for our enemies, but our allies. Well, at least for the traitors amongst them. And who the traitors were, well, that was earth-shaking news</strong>.

                  Everything is so strange... two nights ago the weirdest thing happened... I fell asleep during the night watch at my brother's bed, must have been only for a few minutes, but when I opened my eyes, <strong>I saw a black... being... hovering over Arthei's bed, getting closer and closer to him. I wanted to jump to my feet and scream, but I was unable to move</strong>. All I could do was dig my nails into my own flesh. <strong>Then suddenly, the being looked directly into my eyes. I remember thinking 'how strange', because the creature had no face and thus no eyes, yet I knew that it was looking at me. Then I couldn't bear the COLD of its look anymore and passed out</strong>. I don't know what happened afterwards. All that matters now is that Arthei has recovered. And with recovered I mean that there is not a SCRATCH on him anymore. He is completely well, I'm not able to explain why, but I don't care. Kala is crying for joy, I think the black being wasn't evil, but a god.

After a few days he managed to sleep through. <strong>Getting ever more tranquil in the process</strong>. When conscious he never answered any questions clearly or even directly. His mind constantly drifting away, <strong>there was not much sense in what he said</strong>. Yet some of his ramblings showed a certain method behind his thoughts. He actually tried to keep his mind occupied, <strong>distracted from... something</strong>. As if the mere thought was more horrifying than everything else. <strong>While his subconsciousness could barely keep his mind in check during his sleep, he finally managed to compose himself during the day</strong>. This gave evidence not only of a significant intelligence but also a great mind. <strong>In a week's time, he gained a state of calm serenity neither me nor a healer could get him out of.

            <p>Now, all information we find on Zathroth secret library and the forgotten knowledge suddenly all makes sense.</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p><strong>Behind The Veil Of Ignorance I</strong></p>
               <p><strong>Zathroth's shrouded hoard of forbidden knowledge</strong> is known by many names in many cultures.<br>
                  Parts of this hoard of ancient knowledge were compiled <strong>by races</strong> long gone and creatures that were not meant to exist. Other parts manifested on their own by means so unfathomable, only some book hidden away in that library might tell about.<br>
                  ...<br>
                  Yet some parts of the compiled information was gained by <strong>whisperers in the dark that claimed to be on a mission of enlightenment</strong>.<br>
                  ...<br>
                  It is said that much of the hoard's knowledge was gained by divine insights of Zathroth. Some might just be <strong>the ramblings of madmen but still contain disturbing insights</strong>.<br>
                  ...<br>
                  Most texts are said to hold the secrets of <strong>acquiring more arcane power for oneself</strong> - yet to a terrible price. But to the people who ventured that far into the territory of dark knowledge, these prices seem trivial at best.<br>
                  Some of the knowledge centers on <strong>summoning forth unspeakable things</strong> from beyond the known worlds, out of abysses of darkness and madness. <strong>Others are supposed to bend elements, space, minds and souls to the will of the user</strong>.<br>
                  The accumulated knowledge is <strong>immense and twisted</strong> to condense and enrich it even more in a way that words can't truly contain it any longer.<br>
                  Most books are <strong>encrusted with wards and sigils</strong> that try to contain as much of the knowledge as possible bound to the volume.<br>
                  The knowledge is still so powerful and potent that it often gained a form of will on its own and maliciously preyed on the minds of the unwary. <strong>This knowledge acts like a parasite, draining its bearers soul and mind, whispering misleading and tainted lies, drawing them deeper onto forbidden paths</strong>.<br>
                  ...<br>
                  Secrets thought long lost and <strong>deceptively easy answers to tantalising questions are bound to lead scholars and mystics alike to treachery and the denouncement of all gods but Zathroth</strong>.

Fanatics of Zathroth claim that the library also contains at least parts of '<strong>the true speech</strong>', <strong>the first and only true language</strong>, the <strong>syllables</strong> the gods whispered at the dawn of creation.</p>

               <p>Day 56: <strong>Not everyone seems to get used to how the gates work</strong>. I refrain from making this any simpler, our security and safety is at risk. Not to mention the whole operation. <strong>You just need to have the right coordinates in your sphere. It's not hard</strong> and I certainly won't give them any hints.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In one part of Opticording Sphere quest, a parchment even pops out with Jekhr characters representing binary.</p>
            <p><img src="_resources/e08a75ea56c54687935d5928ebe4d4d4.png" alt="270a0aba0d7103ad2f5048388a5675c7.png"></p>
            <p>And last but not least, with 469 we can get new leads in Serpentine Tower.</p>

            <p>It's pretty darn clear that this is a dream machine.</p>
            <p>What do we get, when we put our cardinal centre at serpentine tower?</p>

            <p>It is said that snakes give eternal life.<br>
               We can control gates by using similar components.
            </p>
            <p>It looks like all we are missing is slime.. and mayhaps a <a data-from-md title='https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/Fruit_Sacrifices_(Book)' href='https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/Fruit_Sacrifices_(Book)'>trick</a> or two.<br>
               All elements combined creates necromancy.<br>
               This is why the Nightmare Knights' dreams were so sinister, and they went crazy.

            <p>Ring of ending? There is one house in Roshamuul that has been repaired with something other than terracotta.<br>
               I think the captain with The First Mate lived here for some time, to spread the message of the ring of ending.

            <p>As the people of Serpentine Tower wanted to, carefully calculate the right timing, the waxing and waning of the magic web.</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>Suns and Stars I<br>
                  We consequently hope to achieve through close observation and through <strong>careful calculation a measure of exactness concerning the right timing of rituals which we did not dare dream of so far</strong>. Several magic incantations we have never managed to reproduce until now might actually be achieved once we know the ideal stellar constellations. <strong>This would explain why all our previous attempts to achieve these effects were doomed to fail</strong>.

            <h1 id="final-words">Final Words</h1>
            <p>Sadly I cannot test anything, as I have not completed opticording sphere quest nor Dream Courts.<br>
               I found that the quests revolving Zathroth, Dream Courts, Mysterious ornate chest are filled with missions where you open gates and try to see the 'threads' and ghosts of the magic web.<br>
               Using keys to open doors.<br>
               Pretty much every quest we go gather powerful relics, phoenix egg? or the glooth-generating rotworm gland, i mean rotworm queen gland? Banana chocolate shake? In quests, we use these for various rituals.. these seems to be important! Shadows of Yalahar quest gives interesting insights! Ape City Quest too! And especially Explorer's society quest!<br>
               Pretty much all quests do.
            </p>
            <p>But I will help in the hunt.</p>
            <p>Maybe Serpentine Tower could be solved now, but I did not test anything yet.</p>
            <p>What do I think the rewards are?<br>
               Well, after thinking about it - I have fantasized about these:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>Imagine fixing the dream catcher and using its now collected powers to open a door to a whole new planet, where we see remnants of the ancient races that fought in the corpse wars. All ancients that attacked the dream catcher, teleported into realms far beyond Tibia, all sorts of weak, strong, some seriously strong wretched things and the gods themselves. Completely new landscapes, planets, cities like Roshamuul..</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Imagine teleporting to a cottage in the clouds, the true shrine of the Mad Mage, a wonderful place with wicked books giving insights into what happened during the time of the corpse wars and before, maybe even the first days. Oh how I hope for that.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Imagine unlocking a whole new way of teleportion around Tibia like the ancient warlocks, rivalling that of the shipping industry. Knightwatch tower but more accessible, and more options.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Imagine getting a character trait/mode that can teleport anywhere a normal player could walk, with extreme invis mode.. not being able to interact nor attack except levers and such... imagine how much you could explore.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Imagine holding a warlord sword, would be a tantalizing childhood dream come true.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>I want to see Undersea.</p>
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This theory and the small theories within might not be 100% accurate as time changes, new things are found, and the lore evolves, but I'd say it's pretty darn close.</p>
            <p>I hope you enjoyed this. I have spent an ungodly amount of hours to find, plan and write this for you.</p>
            <p>I hope I have inspired you or anyone to go and explore in Tibia. The lore is so wonderful, nothing like it. Immerse yourself.</p>
            <p>I hope we can band together now with this decoy out of the way, and tackle quests that has not been completed yet.</p>
            <p>I am confident that there is a solution to Troll Sabotage, Beregar, Topsy &amp; Turvy, Seprentine Tower, probably more hidden in NPC dialogues.</p>
            <p>I go by many names, s2w on reddit, Cony Island on Discord, s2ward on Twitch and GitHub. Simula ingame.<br>
               I am saving up for a 500-600 paladin, so I can soon be with you and try all our new ideas!
            </p>
            <p>I am planning to test streaming on Twitch, wandering around and exploring lore, trying to figure out puzzles and to tackle the remaining mysteries.<br>
               You can find me in some time at:<br>

               Let's maybe chat?
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps read about warlord sword? Or Troll sabotage? I've got more on reddit: /r/SolvingTibia - I even have some videos.<br>
               I removed some of my previous older work that didn't contain stories, they spoiled too much and were too large. I don't want to take all the fun from you, and I am not really satisfied with them. The rest I leave be, they remind me of my journey and are IMO mostly correct.
